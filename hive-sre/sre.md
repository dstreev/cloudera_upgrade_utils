## SRE Application (sre)

The Sre Tool brings together information from the HMS RDBMS and HDFS to provide reports and potential actions to address areas of concern.  This process is a READ-ONLY process and does not perform any actions automatically.

Action commands for identified scenarios are written out to file(s), which can be reviewed / edited and run through either "beeline" for "hive" actions or in [Hadoop-CLI](https://github.com/dstreev/hadoop-cli) for hdfs commands.

This process is driven by a control file.  A template is [here](configs/default.template.yaml).  Make a copy, edit the needed parameters and reference it with the '-cfg' parameter when running the process.

### Known Issues

For a while during the evolution of Hive 3, there was a separate 'catalog' for Spark.  The queries in this process do NOT consider this alternate catalog and may yield cross products in some areas if the 'spark' catalog was used at any point.  Do to the nature of this tool and an attempt to use it across multiple versions of Hive, we do NOT include criteria regarding the 'catalog'.

### Assumptions

- Ran from a node on the cluster
    - That includes clients and configuration files for HDFS
- Ran by a user that has READ privileges to all HDFS directories.
- If cluster is 'kerberized', the user has a valid Kerberos Ticket 'before' starting the application.
- Drivers for the HMS database are available.
- The configuration file has been defined
- The HMS Metastore DB is on a supported RDBMS for the platform (version matters!)

### Application Help

```
Launching: sre
usage: Sre
 -cfg,--config <arg>     Config with details for the Sre Job.  Must match
                         the either sre or u3 selection.
 -db,--database <arg>    Comma separated list of Databases.  Will override
                         config. (upto 100)
 -i,--include <arg>      Comma separated list of process id's to run.
                         When not specified, ALL processes are run.
 -o,--output-dir <arg>   Output Directory to save results from Sre.
```

The `-db` parameter is optional.  When specified, it will limit the search to the databases listed as a parameter.  IE: `-db my_db,test_db`

The `-o` parameter is *required*.

To limit which process runs, use the `-i` (include) option at the command line with a comma separated list of ids (below) of desired processes.

| id (link to sample report) | process |
|:---|:---|
| [1](./sample_reports/sre/hms_report_summary.md) | Hive Metastore Summary<br/> - Numerous HMS reports outlining summary information about databases and tables |
| [2](./sample_reports/sre/hms_report_detail.md) | Hive Metastore Details<br/> - Numerous HMS reports outlining detailed information about databases and tables |
| [3](./sample_reports/sre/small_files.md) | Table and Partition Scan - Small Files |
| [4](./sample_reports/sre/table_volume.md) | Table and Partition Scan - Volume Report |
| [5](./sample_reports/sre/empty_datasets.md) | Table and Partition Scan - Empty Datasets |
| [6](./sample_reports/u3/managed_compactions.sql) | Table and Partition Compactions |
| [8](./sample_reports/sre/acid_analyze_tables.md) | Analyze Tables (beta - use `-i 8` to activate) |
| [9](./sample_reports/sre/acid_analyze_tables_detailed.md) | Analyze Tables - Detailed (beta - use `-i 9` to activate) |

Sre needs to be run by a user with READ access to all the potential HDFS locations presented by the database/table/partition defined locations.
